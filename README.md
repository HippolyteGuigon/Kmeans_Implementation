# Implementation of a KMeans algorithm in Python 

The goal of this repository is to code an implementation of the KMeans algorithm. 

The Kmeans algorithm is a non-supervised Machine Learning Clustering algorithm 
which takes as input a set of points. The KMeans algorithm will create K groups 
among which those points will be reparted, K being chosen by the user.
